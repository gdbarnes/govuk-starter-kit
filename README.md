## govuk starter kit

Generates the necessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript and imagery to be used when starting ESFA web projects

```sh
Clone repo: https://github.com/gdbarnes/govuk-starter-kit.git
```

In your terminal

```sh
yarn
```

```sh
yarn start
```

Once viewing the application you'll be able to see the status of your local packages. Assuming they are up to date, use the buttons to `Generate assets` > `Create archive file` > `Download assets.zip`. Progress of these actions can be seen in your terminal.

Tho contents of `assets.zip` should be placed in the web root of the new project. The markup shown in the app can then be used as a base layout.
